## Exporting Embedded Fields for Batch Importing in Qualtrics
# Exporting
This 3.1 version includes a functionality to export a csv file with all attributes and levels in the survey. To export, click on "Edit > Export Embedded Fields"
The csv will contain two rows. The top row includes one cell for each embedded field, and the second row is NA (otherwise qualtrics recognizes the file as empty).

# Importing into Qualtrics Survey Flow
Currently, the only method to batch import embedded fields to the Survey Flow is to use the "Add from Contacts", function. There are 4 steps.
1) Go to your Qualtrics directory and create a new list, name it anything you want (e.g. "embedded"). You will be prompted to add a file. Upload your csv with the embedded fields here. Make sure that the delimiter is set to "comma", and click "next".
2) Inspect the fields to be imported and make sure that they are all set to "Import as field	> Embedded Data".
3) Return to your Survey Flow, and click on "Add from Contacts > My Library > embedded".
4) Check the "select all tags" (or manually select the ones you want to import) and click OK. Voil√†!
